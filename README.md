# Roy the RPG

Hey, Scratchers! This is a sample repository to put Scratch projects into Android/Amazon Apps!
Feel free to fork my repo and upload your own game to the App Stores.

## Information
This is the compiled repository with the source code of nathan/phosphorus and an index.html linked to the Scratch project that I'm using as a demonstration. All you need to do to link your project is **change "var ProjectID" to the number at the end of your project's URL!** It's that simple!
After that, just use Adobe PhoneGap to compile your project to an .apk file. If you have any questions, just check [the official forum topic on Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/91282/). If you can't find what you're looking for, just post your question.
